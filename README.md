# Hi there! I'm Melody He ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ Aspiring Data Scientist | ðŸ“Š Machine Learning Enthusiast

## About Me
- ðŸ’» Senior at Rice University studying computer science
- ðŸ“š Currently learning advanced ML techniques through Break Through Tech AI
- ðŸ“Š Former data analyst intern at Red Ventures
- ðŸ§  Interested in Natural Language Processing, Generative AI, and Predictive Analytics
- ðŸŽ¶ Fun Fact: I am a DJ @ KTRU, Rice University's student radio station

## Skills
- **Languages:** Python, R, Java, SQL
- **Tools:** Tableau, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Git

## Featured Project: Topic Modeling for Clorox
What We Did: Developed topic modeling modules to extract key themes from online customer reviews. Created improved alternatives to an existing solution that produced excessive topics (100-300) for each product subcategory.

My Accomplishments: Implemented and refined a new modeling approach: LDA2Vec

Achieved comparable topic quality to the original BERTopic implementation using LDA2Vec, a lightweight, efficient topic modeling algorithm
Developed topic evaluation method using sentence transformers and similarity score
Tools: Python, Gensim (LDA2Vec), scikit-learn (LSA), Top2Vec, BERTopic, Groq (to use Llama3), HuggingFace sentence-transformers

Result: Models generate 10-20 representative topics per product subcategory, enabling marketing and R&D teams to focus on critical customer feedback. Reduced topic modeling costs by using Llama3 instead of OpenAI.
